  abstract = {The ability to apply controlled forces to individual molecules has been revolutionary in shaping our understanding of biophysics in areas as diverse as dynamic bond strength, biological motor operation, and DNA replication. However, the methodology to perform single-molecule experiments remains relatively inaccessible because of cost and complexity. In 2010, we introduced the centrifuge force microscope (CFM) as a platform for accessible and high-throughput single-molecule experimentation. The CFM consists of a rotating microscope with which prescribed centrifugal forces can be applied to microsphere-tethered biomolecules. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a next-generation Wi-Fi CFM that offers unprecedented ease of use and flexibility in design. The modular CFM unit fits within a standard benchtop centrifuge and connects by Wi-Fi to an external computer for live control and streaming at near gigabit speeds. The use of commercial wireless hardware allows for flexibility in programming and provides a streamlined upgrade path as Wi-Fi technology advances. To facilitate ease of use, detailed build and setup instructions, as well as LabVIEW-based control software and MATLAB-based analysis software, are provided. We demonstrate the instrument's performance by analysis of force-dependent dissociation of short DNA duplexes of 7, 8, and 9 bp. We showcase the sensitivity of the approach by resolving distinct dissociation kinetic rates for a 7 bp duplex in which one G-C basepair is mutated to an A-T basepair.},

  abstract = {From sensing leucine to metabolic control                            The mTORC1 protein kinase complex plays central roles in regulating cell growth and metabolism and is implicated in common human diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The level of the amino acid leucine tells an organism a lot about its physiological state, including how much food is available, how much insulin is going to be needed, and whether new muscle mass can be made (see the Perspective by Buel and Blenis). Wolfson               et al.               identified a biochemical sensor of leucine, Sestrin2, which connects the concentration of leucine to the control of organismal metabolism and growth. When leucine bound to Sestrin2, it was released from a complex with the mTORC1 regulatory factor GATOR2, activating the mTORC1 complex. Saxton               et al.               describe the crystal structure of Sestrin2 and show how it specifically detects leucine. Aylett               et al.               determined the structure of human mTORC1 by cryoelectron microscopy and the crystal structure of a regulatory subunit, Raptor. The results reveal the structural basis for the function and intricate regulation of this important enzyme, which is also a strategic drug target.

Dysregulation of mammalian TOR (mTOR) signaling is implicated in pathologies that include diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. We resolved the architecture of human mTORC1 (mTOR with subunits Raptor and mLST8) bound to FK506 binding protein (FKBP)\textendash rapamycin, by combining cryo\textendash electron microscopy at 5.9 angstrom resolution with crystallographic studies of               Chaetomium thermophilum               Raptor at 4.3 angstrom resolution. The structure explains how FKBP-rapamycin and architectural elements of mTORC1 limit access to the recessed active site. Consistent with a role in substrate recognition and delivery, the conserved amino-terminal domain of Raptor is juxtaposed to the kinase active site.},

  abstract = {Rapamycin is an important immunosuppressant, a possible anticancer therapeutic, and a widely used research tool. Essential to its various functions is its ability to bind simultaneously to two different proteins, FKBP and mTOR. Despite its widespread use, a thorough analysis of the interactions between FKBP, rapamycin, and the rapamycin-binding domain of mTOR, FRB, is lacking. To probe the affinities involved in the formation of the FKBP,rapamycin,FRB complex, we used fluorescence polarization, surface plasmon resonance, and NMR spectroscopy. Analysis of the data shows that rapamycin binds to FRB with moderate affinity (Kd ) 26 ( 0.8 \textmu M). The FKBP12,rapamycin complex, however, binds to FRB 2000-fold more tightly (Kd ) 12 ( 0.8 nM) than rapamycin alone. No interaction between FKBP and FRB was detected in the absence of rapamycin. These studies suggest that rapamycin's ability to bind to FRB, and by extension to mTOR, in the absence of FKBP is of little consequence under physiological conditions. Furthermore, protein-protein interactions at the FKBP12-FRB interface play a role in the stability of the ternary complex. Downloaded via AIX-MARSEILLE UNIV on June 20, 2022 at 10:48:15 (UTC).},

  abstract = {Significance             In the dynamic environment of the airways, where SARS-CoV-2 infections are initiated by binding to human host receptor ACE2, mechanical stability of the viral attachment is a crucial fitness advantage. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques, we mimic the effect of coughing and sneezing, thereby testing the force stability of SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2 interaction under physiological conditions. Our results reveal a higher force stability of SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1, causing a possible fitness advantage. Our assay is sensitive to blocking agents preventing RBD:ACE2 bond formation. It will thus provide a powerful approach to investigate the modes of action of neutralizing antibodies and other agents designed to block RBD binding to ACE2 that are currently developed as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.           ,              Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are initiated by attachment of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the viral Spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on human host cells. This critical first step occurs in dynamic environments, where external forces act on the binding partners and avidity effects play an important role, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using magnetic tweezers and atomic force spectroscopy as highly complementary single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the RBD:ACE2 interaction over the whole physiologically relevant force range. We combine the experimental results with steered molecular dynamics simulations and observe and assign fully consistent unbinding and unfolding events across the three techniques, enabling us to establish ACE2 unfolding as a molecular fingerprint. Measuring at forces of 2 to 5 pN, we quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the RBD:ACE2 bond in equilibrium. We show that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, larger binding free energy, and a lower dissociation rate compared to SARS-CoV-1, which helps to rationalize the different infection patterns of the two viruses. By studying how free ACE2 outcompetes tethered ACE2, we show that our assay is sensitive to prevention of bond formation by external binders. We expect our results to provide a way to investigate the roles of viral mutations and blocking agents for targeted pharmaceutical intervention.},

  abstract = {We used a force-measuring laser tweezers apparatus to determine the elastic properties of ␭-bacteriophage DNA as a function of ionic strength and in the presence of multivalent cations. The electrostatic contribution to the persistence length P varied as the inverse of the ionic strength in monovalent salt, as predicted by the standard worm-like polyelectrolyte model. However, ionic strength is not always the dominant variable in determining the elastic properties of DNA. Monovalent and multivalent ions have quite different effects even when present at the same ionic strength. Multivalent ions lead to P values as low as 250\textendash 300 \AA, well below the high-salt ``fully neutralized'' value of 450\textendash 500 \AA{} characteristic of DNA in monovalent salt. The ions Mg2؉ and Co(NH3)63؉, in which the charge is centrally concentrated, yield lower P values than the polyamines putrescine2؉ and spermidine3؉, in which the charge is linearly distributed. The elastic stretch modulus, S, and P display opposite trends with ionic strength, in contradiction to predictions of macroscopic elasticity theory. DNA is well described as a worm-like chain at concentrations of trivalent cations capable of inducing condensation, if condensation is prevented by keeping the molecule stretched. A retractile force appears in the presence of multivalent cations at molecular extensions that allow intramolecular contacts, suggesting condensation in stretched DNA occurs by a ``thermal ratchet'' mechanism.},

Previously, a mammalian protein that directly associates with FKBP12-rapamycin has been identified and its encoding gene has been cloned from both human (designated FRAP) [Brown, E. J., Albers, M. W., Shin, T. B., Ichikawa, K., Keith, C. T., Lane, W. S. \& Schreiber, S. L. (1994) Nature (London) 369, 756-758] and rat (designated RAFT) [Sabatini, D.

Using an in vitro transcription/translation assay method coupled with proteolysis studies, we have identified an 11-kDa FKBP12-rapamycinbinding domain within FRAP. This minimal binding domain lies N-terminal to the kinase domain and spans residues 2025-2114. In addition, we have carried out mutagenesis studies to investigate the role of Ser2035, a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C within this domain. We now show that the FRAP Ser2035 -* Ala mutant displays similar binding affinity when compared with the wild-type protein, whereas all other mutations at this site, including mimics of phosphoserine, abolish binding, presumably due to either unfavorable steric interactions or induced conformational changes.},

We introduce a class of unistable one-dimensional potential surfaces that encompass previous models as special cases and continuously cover the entire range from ductile to brittle. Compact analytic expressions for force-dependent rates and rupture-force distributions allow us to analyze force-clamp and force-ramp pulling experiments. We find that the force-transmitting protein domains of filamin and titin are kinetically ductile when pulled from their two termini, making them resistant to force spikes. For the mechanostable muscle protein titin, a highly ductile model reconciles data over 10 orders of magnitude in force loading rate from experiment and simulation.},

  abstract = {Magnetic tweezers are a wide-spread tool used to study the mechanics and the function of a large variety of biomolecules and biomolecular machines. This tool uses a magnetic particle and a strong magnetic field gradient to apply defined forces to the molecule of interest. Forces are typically quantified by analyzing the lateral fluctuations of the biomolecule-tethered particle in the direction perpendicular to the applied force. Since the magnetic field pins the anisotropy axis of the particle, the lateral fluctuations follow the geometry of a pendulum with a short pendulum length along and a long pendulum length perpendicular to the field lines. Typically, the short pendulum geometry is used for force calibration by power-spectral-density (PSD) analysis, because the movement of the bead in this direction can be approximated by a simple translational motion. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the fluctuations according to the long pendulum geometry and show that for this direction, both the translational and the rotational motions of the particle have to be considered. We provide analytical formulas for the PSD of this coupled system that agree well with PSDs obtained in experiments and simulations and that finally allow a faithful quantification of the magnetic force for the long pendulum geometry. We furthermore demonstrate that this methodology allows the calibration of much larger forces than the short pendulum geometry in a tether-length-dependent manner. In addition, the accuracy of determination of the absolute force is improved. Our force calibration based on the long pendulum geometry will facilitate high-resolution magnetic-tweezers experiments that rely on short molecules and large forces, as well as highly parallelized measurements that use low frame rates.},

  abstract = {Biological functions of proteins rely on their specific interactions with binding partners. Many proteins contain multiple domains, which can bind to their targets that often have more than one binding site, resulting in multivalent interactions. While it has been shown that multivalent interactions play a crucial role in modulating binding affinity and specificity, other potential effects of multivalent interactions are less explored. Here, we developed a broadly applicable transfer-matrix formalism and used it to investigate the binding of two-domain ligands to targets with multiple binding sites. We show that 1) ligands with two specific binding domains can drastically boost both the binding affinity and specificity and downshift the working concentration range, compared with single-domain ligands, 2) the presence of a positive domain-domain cooperativity or containing a nonspecific binding domain can downshift the working concentration range of ligands by increasing the binding affinity without compromising the binding specificity, and 3) the configuration of the bound ligands has a strong concentration dependence, providing important insights into the physical origin of phase-separation processes taking place in living cells. In line with previous studies, our results suggest that multivalent interactions are utilized by cells for highly efficient regulation of target binding involved in a diverse range of cellular processes such as signal transduction, gene transcription, and antibody-antigen recognition.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule force-spectroscopy methods such as magnetic and optical tweezers have emerged as powerful tools for the detailed study of biomechanical aspects of DNAenzyme interactions. As typically only a single molecule of DNA is addressed in an individual experiment, these methods suffer from a low data throughput. Here, we report a novel method for targeted, nonrandom immobilization of DNA-tethered magnetic beads in regular arrays through microcontact printing of DNA end-binding labels. We show that the increase in density due to the arrangement of DNA-bead tethers in regular arrays can give rise to a one-order-of-magnitude improvement in data-throughput in magnetic tweezers experiments. We demonstrate the applicability of this technique in tweezers experiments where up to 450 beads are simultaneously tracked in parallel, yielding statistical data on the mechanics of DNA for 357 molecules from a single experimental run. Our technique paves the way for kilomolecule force spectroscopy experiments, enabling the study of rare events in DNA\`Aprotein interactions and the acquisition of large statistical data sets from individual experimental runs.},

  abstract = {Structural characterization of small molecule binding site hotspots within the global proteome is uniquely enabled by photoaffinity labeling (PAL) coupled with chemical enrichment and unbiased analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based binding site maps provide structural resolution of interaction sites in conjunction with identification of target proteins. However, binding site hotspot mapping has been confined to relatively simple small molecules to date; extension to more complex compounds would enable the structural definition of new binding modes in the proteome. Here, we extend PAL and MS methods to derive a binding site hotspot map for the immunosuppressant rapamycin, a complex macrocyclic natural product that forms a ternary complex with the proteins FKBP12 and FRB. Photorapamycin was developed as a diazirine-based PAL probe for rapamycin, and the FKBP12-photo-rapamycin-FRB ternary complex formed readily in vitro. Photoirradiation, digestion, and MS analysis of the ternary complex revealed a McLafferty rearrangement product of photo-rapamycin conjugated to specific surfaces on FKBP12 and FRB. Molecular modeling based on the binding site map revealed two distinct conformations of complex-bound photo-rapamycin, providing a 5.0 \AA{} distance constraint between the conjugated residues and the diazirine carbon and a 9.0 \AA{} labeling radius for the diazirine upon photoactivation. These measurements may be broadly useful in the interpretation of binding site measurements from PAL. Thus, in characterizing the ternary complex of photo-rapamycin by MS, we applied binding site hotspot mapping to a macrocyclic natural product and extracted precise structural measurements for interpretation of PAL products that may enable the discovery of new binding sites in the ``undruggable'' proteome.},

  abstract = {Antibodies are key tools in biomedical research and medicine. Their binding properties are classically measured in solution and characterized by an affinity. However, in physiological conditions, antibodies can bridge an immune effector cell and an antigen-presenting cell, implying that mechanical forces may apply to the bonds. For example, in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity\textemdash a major mode of action of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies\textemdash the Fab domains bind the antigens on the target cell, whereas the Fc domain binds to the activating receptor CD16 (also known as FcgRIII) of an immune effector cell, in a quasi-bidimensional environment (2D). Therefore, there is a strong need to investigate antigen/antibody binding under force (2D) to better understand and predict antibody activity in vivo. We used two anti-CD16 nanobodies targeting two different epitopes and laminar flow chamber assay to measure the association and dissociation of single bonds formed between microsphere-bound CD16 antigens and surface-bound anti-CD16 nanobodies (or single-domain antibodies), simulating 2D encounters. The two nanobodies exhibit similar 2D association kinetics, characterized by a strong dependence on the molecular encounter duration. However, their 2D dissociation kinetics strongly differ as a function of applied force: one exhibits a slip bond behavior in which off rate increases with force, and the other exhibits a catch-bond behavior in which off rate decreases with force. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that catch-bond behavior was reported for antigen-antibody bond. Quantification of natural killer cells spreading on surfaces coated with the nanobodies provides a comparison between 2D and threedimensional adhesion in a cellular context, supporting the hypothesis of natural killer cell mechanosensitivity. Our results may also have strong implications for the design of efficient bispecific antibodies for therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Cantilevers and optical tweezers are widely used for micromanipulating cells or biomolecules for measuring their mechanical properties. However, they do not allow easy rotary motion and can sometimes damage the handled material. We present here a system of magnetic tweezers that overcomes those drawbacks while retaining most of the previous dynamometers properties. Electromagnets are coupled to a microscope-based particle tracking system through a digital feedback loop. Magnetic beads are first trapped in a potential well of stiffness ϳ10Ϫ7 N/m. Thus, they can be manipulated in three dimensions at a speed of ϳ10 ␮m/s and rotated along the optical axis at a frequency of 10 Hz. In addition, our apparatus can work as a dynamometer relying on either usual calibration against the viscous drag or complete calibration using Brownian fluctuations. By stretching a DNA molecule between a magnetic particle and a glass surface, we applied and measured vertical forces ranging from 50 fN to 20 pN. Similarly, nearly horizontal forces up to 5 pN were obtained. From those experiments, we conclude that magnetic tweezers represent a low-cost and biocompatible setup that could become a suitable alternative to the other available micromanipulators.},

Nucleic acids have played a central role in this effort because, in addition to their biological significance, they exhibit unique polymeric properties which have recast them as key components participating in numerous experimental designs. In this review, we introduce recent developments highlighting this dual nature of nucleic acids in biophysics, as objects of study but also as tools allowing novel approaches. More specifically, we present molecular scaffolds as an emerging concept and describe their use in single-molecule force spectroscopy. Aspects related to folding and noncovalent interactions will be presented in parallel to research in enzymology, with a focus on the acquisition of thermodynamic and kinetic data.},

  abstract = {Precise manipulation of single molecules has already led to remarkable insights in physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, widespread adoption of single-molecule techniques has been impeded by equipment cost and the laborious nature of making measurements one molecule at a time. We have solved these issues by developing an approach that enables massively parallel single-molecule force measurements using centrifugal force. This approach is realized in an instrument that we call the centrifuge force microscope in which objects in an orbiting sample are subjected to a calibration-free, macroscopically uniform force-field while their micro-to-nanoscopic motions are observed. We demonstrate high-throughput singlemolecule force spectroscopy with this technique by performing thousands of rupture experiments in parallel, characterizing force-dependent unbinding kinetics of an antibody-antigen pair in minutes rather than days. Additionally, we verify the force accuracy of the instrument by measuring the well-established DNA overstretching transition at 66 5 3 pN. With significant benefits in efficiency, cost, simplicity, and versatility, single-molecule centrifugation has the potential to expand single-molecule experimentation to a wider range of researchers and experimental systems.},

  abstract = {Recent methods in DNA nanotechnology are enabling the creation of intricate nanostructures through the use of programmable, bottom-up self-assembly. However, structures consisting only of DNA are limited in their ability to act on other biomolecules. Proteins, on the other hand, perform a variety of functions on biological materials, but directed control of the self-assembly process remains a challenge. While DNA\textendash protein hybrids have the potential to provide the best-of-both-worlds, they can be difficult to create as many of the conventional techniques for linking proteins to DNA render proteins dysfunctional. We present here a sortase-based protocol for covalently coupling proteins to DNA with minimal disturbance to protein function. To accomplish this we have developed a two-step process. First, a small synthetic peptide is bioorthogonally and covalently coupled to a DNA oligo using click chemistry. Next, the DNA\textendash peptide chimera is covalently linked to a protein of interest under protein-compatible conditions using the enzyme sortase. Our protocol allows for the simple coupling and purification of a functional DNA\textendash protein hybrid. We use this technique to form oligos bearing cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15 protein fragments. Upon incorporation into a linear M13 scaffold, these protein\textendash DNA hybrids serve as the gate to a binary nanoswitch. The outlined protocol is reliable and modular, facilitating the construction of libraries of oligos and proteins that can be combined to form functional DNA\textendash protein nanostructures. These structures will enable a new class of functional nanostructures, which could be used for therapeutic and industrial processes.},

We replaced all known UAG stop codons in               Escherichia coli               MG1655 with synonymous UAA codons, which permitted the deletion of release factor 1 and reassignment of UAG translation function. This GRO exhibited improved properties for incorporation of nonstandard amino acids that expand the chemical diversity of proteins in vivo. The GRO also exhibited increased resistance to T7 bacteriophage, demonstrating that new genetic codes could enable increased viral resistance.},

  abstract = {The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein that is intricately involved in signaling pathways controlling cell growth. Rapamycin is a natural product that binds and inhibits mTOR function by interacting with its FKBP-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain. Here we report on the NMR solution structure of FRB and on further studies aimed at the identification and characterization of novel ligands that target the rapamycin binding pocket. The biological activity of the ligands, and that of rapamycin in the absence of FKBP12, was investigated by assaying the kinase activity of mTOR. While we found that rapamycin binds the FRB domain and inhibits the kinase activity of mTOR even in the absence of FKBP12 (in the low micromolar range), our most potent ligands bind to FRB with similar binding affinity but inhibit the kinase activity of mTOR at much higher concentrations. However, we have also identified one low-affinity compound that is also capable of inhibiting mTOR. Hence, we have identified compounds that can directly mimic rapamycin or can dissociate the FRB binding from the inhibition of the catalytic activity of mTOR. As such, these ligands could be useful in deciphering the complex regulation of mTOR in the cell and in validating the FRB domain as a possible target for the development of novel therapeutic compounds.},

The G-rich overhang could fold back and bind in the major groove of its upstream duplex, forming an antiparallel triplex structure. The telomeric triplex has been proposed to function in protecting chromosome ends. However, we lack strategies to mechanically probe the dynamics of a telomeric triplex. Here, we show that the topological dynamics of a telomeric triplex involves 3 overhang binding at the ds/ssDNA junction inferred by DNA mechanics. Assisted by click chemistry and branched polymerase chain reaction, we developed a rescue-rope-strategy for mechanically manipulating an artificial telomeric DNA with a free end. Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers, we identified a rarely forming (5\%) telomeric triplex which pauses at an intermediate state upon unzipping the Watson\textendash Crick paired duplex. Our findings revealed that a mechanically stable triplex formed in a telomeric DNA can resist a force of 20 pN for a few seconds in a physiological buffer. We also demonstrated that the rescue-rope-strategy assisted mechanical manipulation can directly rupture the interactions between the third strand and its targeting duplex in a DNA triplex. Our single-molecule rescue-rope-strategy will serve as a general tool to investigate telomere dynamics and further develop triplex-based biotechnologies.},

Their function is intimately linked to their position at and within the membrane which provides accessibility, mobility as well as membrane proximal cytoskeleton anchoring, all of these elements playing important roles in the final function and links to cellular actions. Understanding how immune cells integrate the specific signals received at their membrane to take a decision remains an immense challenge and a very active field of fundamental and applied research. Recent progress in imaging and micromanipulation techniques have led to an unprecedented refinement in the description of molecular structures and supramolecular assemblies at the immune cell membrane, and provided a glimpse into their dynamics and regulation by force. Several key elements have been scrutinized such as the roles of relative sizes of molecules, lateral organisation, motion in the membrane of the receptors, but also physical cues such as forces, mediated by cellular substrates of different rigidities or applied by the cell itself, in conjunction with its partner cell. We review here these recent discoveries associated with a description of the biophysical methods used. While a conclusive picture integrating all of these components is still lacking, mainly due to the implication of diverse and different mechanisms and spatio-temporal scales involved, the amount of quantitative data available opens the way for physical modelling and numerical simulations and new avenues for experimental research.},

The high specificity and precision of PPI measurements made it possible to reveal detailed mechanisms of intermolecular interactions. However, protein aggregation due to specific or nonspecific interactions is among the most challenging problems in PPI examination. Here, we propose a strategy of a parallel DNA circuit to probe PPI using singlemolecule magnetic tweezers. In contrast to PPI examination using atomic force microscopy, microspheres as probes used in magnetic tweezers avoided the single-probe issue of a cantilever. Negatively charged DNA as a linker circumvented the severe aggregation in the PPI construct with a protein linker. The unnatural amino acid encoded in proteins of interest expanded the choices of biorthogonal conjugation. We demonstrated how to apply our strategy to probe the PPI between the PHD3-Bromo and the histone H3 methylated at K4, a critical epigenetic event in leukemia development. We found a rupture force of 12 pN for breaking the PPI, which is much higher than that required to peel DNA off from a nucleosome, 3 pN. We expect that our methods will make PPI measurements of mechanics and kinetics with great precision, facilitating PPI-related research, e.g., PPI-targeted drug discovery.},

The requirement to stably attach ``molecular handles'' to specific points in the protein of interest by preparative biochemical techniques is a limiting factor in applying this methodology, especially for large or unstable proteins that are difficult to produce and isolate. Here, we present a streamlined approach for creating stable and specific attachments using autocatalytic covalent tethering. The high specificity of coupling allowed us to tether ribosome-nascent chain complexes, demonstrating its suitability for investigating complex macromolecular assemblies. We combined this approach with cell-free protein synthesis, providing a facile means of preparing samples for single-molecule force spectroscopy. The workflow eliminates the need for biochemical protein purification during sample preparation for single-molecule measurements, making structurally unstable proteins amenable to investigation by this powerful single-molecule technique. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach by carrying out pulling experiments with an unstructured domain of elongation factor G that had previously been refractory to analysis. Our approach expands the pool of proteins amenable to folding studies, which should help to reduce existing biases in the currently available set of protein folding models.},

However, mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities are deregulated in widespread human diseases, including cancer. Cancer cells take advantage of mTOR oncogenic signaling to drive their proliferation, survival, metabolic transformation, and metastatic potential. Therefore, mTOR lends itself very well as a therapeutic target for innovative cancer treatment. mTOR was initially identified as the target of the antibiotic rapamycin that displayed remarkable antitumor activity in vitro. Promising preclinical studies using rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogs) demonstrated efficacy in many human cancer types, hence supporting the launch of numerous clinical trials aimed to evaluate the real effectiveness of mTOR-targeted therapies. However, rapamycin and rapalogs have shown very limited activity in most clinical contexts, also when combined with other drugs. Thus, novel classes of mTOR inhibitors with a stronger antineoplastic potency have been developed. Nevertheless, emerging clinical data suggest that also these novel mTOR-targeting drugs may have a weak antitumor activity. Here, we summarize the current status of available mTOR inhibitors and highlight the most relevant results from both preclinical and clinical studies that have provided valuable insights into both their efficacy and failure.},

Currently, the best-\-characterized examples of catch bonds are between single protein-\-ligand pairs. The essential AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) mechanoenzyme Mdn1 drives at least two separate steps in ribosome biogenesis, using its MIDAS domain to extract the ubiquitin-l\-ike (UBL) domain-c\- ontaining proteins Rsa4 and Ytm1 from ribosomal precursors. However, it must subsequently release these assembly factors to reinitiate the enzymatic cycle. The mechanism underlying the switching of the MIDAS-\-UBL interaction between strongly and weakly bound states is unknown. Here, we use optical tweezers to investigate the force dependence of MIDAS-\-UBL binding. Parallel experiments with Rsa4 and Ytm1 show that forces up to \textasciitilde 4 pN, matching the magnitude of force produced by AAA proteins similar to Mdn1, enhance the MIDAS domain binding lifetime up to 10-f\-old, and higher forces accelerate dissociation. Together, our studies indicate that Mdn1's MIDAS domain can form catch bonds with more than one UBL substrate, and provide insights into how mechanoregulation may contribute to the Mdn1 enzymatic cycle during ribosome biogenesis.

This receptor is one of the four members of the ErbB family including ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Ligand binding, like EGF binding, induces a conformational rearrangement of the receptor and induces a homo/hetero dimerization essentially with ErbB family receptors that leads to the phosphorylation of the kinase domain, triggering a signaling cascade. EGFR can also form inactive dimers in a ligand-independent way through interactions between cytoplasmic domains. To date, the conformation of EGFR extracellular domain engaged in these inactive dimers remains unclear. In this study, we describe the successful selection and characterization of llama anti-EGFR nanobodies and their use as innovative conformational sensors. We isolated three different specific anti-EGFR clones binding to three distinct epitopes. Interestingly, the binding of all three nanobodies was found highly sensitive to ligand stimulation. Two nanobodies, D10 and E10, can only bind the ligand-free EGFR conformation characterized by an intramolecular tether between domains II and IV, whereas nanobody G10 binds both ligand-free and ligand activated EGFR, with an 8-fold higher affinity for the extended conformation in the presence of ligand. Here we took advantage of these conformational probes to reveal the existence of tethered EGFR in EGFR/ErbB2 predimers. These biosensors represent important tools allowing the determination of EGFR conformations and should help the design of relevant inhibitors.},

Most experimental methods of active microrheology such as optical tweezers or atomic force microscopy based approaches rely on single cell measurements, and thus suffer from a low throughput. Here, we present a novel method for frequency-dependent microrheology on cells using acoustic forces which allows multiplexed measurements of several cells in parallel. Acoustic force spectroscopy (AFS) is used to generate multi-oscillatory forces in the range of pN\textendash nN on particles attached to primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultivated inside a microfluidic chip. While the AFS was introduced as a single-molecule technique to measure mechanochemical properties of biomolecules, we exploit the AFS to measure the dynamic viscoelastic properties of cells exposed to different conditions, such as flow shear stresses or drug injections. By controlling the force and measuring the position of the particle, the complex shear modulus               G               *(               {$\omega$}               ) can be measured continuously over several hours. The resulting power-law shear moduli are consistent with fractional viscoelastic models. In our experiments we confirm a decrease in shear modulus after perturbing the actin cytoskeleton               via               cytochalasin B. This effect was reversible after washing out the drug. Additionally, we include critical information for the usage of the new method AFS as a measurement tool showing its capabilities and limitations and we find that for performing viscoelastic measurements with the AFS, a thorough calibration and careful data analysis is crucial, for which we provide protocols and guidelines.},

The high flexibility is attributed to the structural dynamics of DNA self-assemblies.           ,              DNA has become a powerful platform to design functional nanodevices. DNA nanodevices are often composed of self-assembled DNA building blocks that differ significantly from the structure of native DNA. In this study, we present Flow Force Microscopy as a massively parallel approach to study the nanomechanics of DNA self-assemblies on the single-molecular level. The high-throughput experiments performed in a simple microfluidic channel enable statistically meaningful studies with nanometer scale precision in a time frame of several minutes. A surprisingly high flexibility was observed for a typical construct used in DNA origami, reflected in a persistence length of 10.2 nm, a factor of five smaller than for native DNA. The enhanced flexibility is attributed to the discontinuous backbone of DNA self-assemblies that facilitate base pair opening by thermal fluctuations at the end of hybridized oligomers. We believe that the results will contribute to the fundamental understanding of DNA nanomechanics and help to improve the design of DNA nanodevices with applications in biological analysis and clinical research.},

Proposed expressions show less than 1 \% relative error in the useful range of the corresponding variables. These results can be applied for fitting forceextension curves obtained in molecular force spectroscopy experiments. Particularly, they can be useful for cases where one has geometries of springs in series and/or in parallel where particular combination of expressions should be used for fitting the data. All approximations have been obtained following the same procedure of determining the asymptotes and then reducing the relative error of that expression by adding an appropriate term obtained from fitting its absolute error.},

The absolute distance between the colloids and the surface was measured under flow with an accuracy of a few nanometers. We could verify the long-term prediction of classical lubrication theory for the movement of a sphere near a wall in a shear flow. The HA polymer layer exerted long-range repulsive steric force on the beads and the hydrodynamics at the boundary remained more or less unchanged. By incubating HA at various concentrations, the thickness of the layer, as estimated by beads most probable height, was tuned in the range 20\textendash 200 nm. Frequency of bond formation was decreased by more than one order of magnitude by increasing the thickness of the repulsive layer, while the lifetime of individual bonds was not affected. This study opens the way for further quantitative studies of the effect of molecular environment and separation distance on ligand-receptor association and dissociation.},

  abstract = {The wormlike chain (WLC) model currently provides the best description of double-stranded DNA elasticity for micron-sized molecules. This theory requires two intrinsic material parameters\textemdash the contour length L and the persistence length p. We measured and then analyzed the elasticity of double-stranded DNA as a function of L (632 nm\textendash 7.03 mm) using the classic solution to the WLC model. When the elasticity data were analyzed using this solution, the resulting fitted value for the persistence length pwlc depended on L; even for moderately long DNA molecules (L {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1300 nm), this apparent persistence length was 10\% smaller than its limiting value for long DNA. Because p is a material parameter, and cannot depend on length, we sought a new solution to the WLC model, which we call the ``finite wormlike chain (FWLC),'' to account for effects not considered in the classic solution. Specifically we accounted for the finite chain length, the chain-end boundary conditions, and the bead rotational fluctuations inherent in optical trapping assays where beads are used to apply the force. After incorporating these corrections, we used our FWLC solution to generate force-extension curves, and then fit those curves with the classic WLC solution, as done in the standard experimental analysis. These results qualitatively reproduced the apparent dependence of pwlc on L seen in experimental data when analyzed with the classic WLC solution. Directly fitting experimental data to the FWLC solution reduces the apparent dependence of pfwlc on L by a factor of 3. Thus, the FWLC solution provides a significantly improved theoretical framework in which to analyze single-molecule experiments over a broad range of experimentally accessible DNA lengths, including both short (a few hundred nanometers in contour length) and very long (microns in contour length) molecules.},

Super-paramagnetic microparticles were developed that have a high and uniform magnetization to simultaneously apply a piconewton-scale tensile force to many thousands of IgG-protein A bonds. A strong and a weak slip bond were detected with an effective bond length that is characteristic of shortrange, stiff intermolecular interactions. These bonds are attributed to the interaction of protein A with the constant region (Fc) and heavy chain variable domain (VH) of IgG, respectively. The IgG-VH interaction appears to be one of the weakest specific molecular interactions that has been identified with a single molecule force measurement technique. This study demonstrates that magnetic tweezers can be used to rapidly characterize very weak biomolecular interactions as well as strong biomolecular interactions with a high degree of accuracy.},

Single-molecule force spectroscopy, including magnetic tweezers (MTs), is an important tool for studying DNA mechanics. However, its application to short DNAs under 1 {$\mu$}m is limited. We developed an MT-based method for precise force-extension measurements in the 100-nm regime that enables in situ correction of the error in DNA extension measurement, and normalizes the force variability across beads by exploiting DNA hairpins. The method reduces the lower limit of tractable dsDNA length down to 198 base pairs (bp) (67 nm), an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to conventional tweezing experiments. Applying this method and the finite worm-like chain model we observed an essentially constant persistence length across the chain lengths studied (198 bp to 10 kbp), which steeply depended on GC content and methylation. This finding suggests a potential sequence-dependent mechanism for short-DNA elasticity.},

The most commonly used method still relies on maleimide chemistry involving cysteine residues in the protein of interest. Studies have consequently often focused on model proteins that either have no cysteines or with a small number of cysteines that can be deleted so that cysteines can then be introduced at specific sites. However, many proteins, especially in eukaryotes, contain too many cysteine residues to be amenable to this strategy, and therefore there is tremendous need for new and broadly applicable approaches to site-specific conjugation. Here we present bioorthogonal approaches for making DNA-protein conjugates required in force spectroscopy experiments. Unnatural amino acids are introduced site-specifically and conjugated to DNA oligos bearing the respective modifications to undergo either strain-promoted azidealkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) or inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IE-DA) reactions. We furthermore show that SPAAC is compatible with a previously published peptide-based attachment approach. By expanding the available toolkit to tag-free methods based on bioorthogonal reactions, we hope to enable researchers to interrogate the mechanics of a much broader range of proteins than is currently possible.},

  abstract = {The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase and a major controller of cell growth. In cells, mTOR forms two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTORC1 complex can phosphorylate 4EBP1 and S6K1, two key regulators of translation initiation, whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT1, an event required for AKT1 activation. Here, we expressed and purified human mTORC1 and mTORC2 from HEK-293 cells using FLAG-M2 affinity chromatography. Western blotting analysis using phospho-specific antibodies indicated that recombinant mTORC1 and mTORC2 exhibit distinct substrate preferences in vitro, consistent with their roles in cells. To improve our understanding of the enzymatic properties of mTOR alone and mTOR in its complex form, steady-state kinetic profiles of truncated mTOR containing the kinase domain (residues 1360-2549) and mTORC1 were determined. The results revealed that mTORC1 is catalytically less active than truncated mTOR, as evidenced by 4.7- and 3.1-fold decreases in catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, for ATP and 4EBP1, respectively. We also found that truncated mTOR undergoes autophosphorylation through an intramolecular mechanism. Mass spectrometric analysis identified two novel mTOR autophosphorylation sites, Ser2454 and either Thr2473 or Thr2474, in addition to the previously reported Ser2481 site. Truncated mTOR and mTORC1 were completely inhibited by ATP competitive inhibitors PI103 and BEZ235 and partially inhibited by rapamycin/FKBP12 in a noncompetitive fashion toward ATP. All inhibitors tested exhibited similar inhibitory potencies between mTORC1 and truncated mTOR containing the kinase domain. Our studies presented here provide the first detailed kinetic studies of a recombinant mTOR complex.},

Here, we report the design of a Fab-like bispecific antibody (HER2bsFab) that displays a moderate affinity for HER2 and a unique, specific and high affinity for Fc{$\gamma$}RIII. In vitro characterization showed that ADCC was the major mechanism of action of HER2bsFab as no significant HER2-driven effect was observed. HER2bsFab mediated ADCC at picomolar concentration against HER2high, HER2low as well as trastuzumab-refractive cell lines. In vivo HER2bsFab potently inhibited HER2high tumor growth by recruitment of mouse Fc{$\gamma$}RIII and IVpositive resident effector cells and more importantly, exhibited a net superiority over trastuzumab at inhibiting HER2low tumor growth. Moreover, Fc{$\gamma$}RIIIA-engagement by HER2bsFab was independent of V/F158 polymorphism and induced a stronger NK cells activation in response to target cell recognition. Thus, taking advantage of its epitope specificity and affinity for HER2 and Fc{$\gamma$}RIIIA, HER2bsFab exhibits potent anti-tumor activity against HER2low tumors while evading most of trastuzumab Fclinked limitations thereby potentially enlarging the number of patients eligible for breast cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {Forced unbinding of complementary macromolecules such as ligand-receptor complexes can reveal energetic and kinetic details governing physiological processes ranging from cellular adhesion to drug metabolism. Although molecular-level experiments have enabled sampling of individual ligand-receptor complex dissociation events, disparities in measured unbinding force FR among these methods lead to marked variation in inferred binding energetics and kinetics at equilibrium. These discrepancies are documented for even the ubiquitous ligand-receptor pair, biotin-streptavidin. We investigated these disparities and examined atomic-level unbinding trajectories via steered molecular dynamics simulations, as well as via molecular force spectroscopy experiments on biotin-streptavidin. In addition to the well-known loading rate dependence of FR predicted by Bell's model, we find that experimentally accessible parameters such as the effective stiffness of the force transducer k can significantly perturb the energy landscape and the apparent unbinding force of the complex for sufficiently stiff force transducers. Additionally, at least 20\% variation in unbinding force can be attributed to minute differences in initial atomic positions among energetically and structurally comparable complexes. For force transducers typical of molecular force spectroscopy experiments and atomistic simulations, this energy barrier perturbation results in extrapolated energetic and kinetic parameters of the complex that depend strongly on k. We present a model that explicitly includes the effect of k on apparent unbinding force of the ligand-receptor complex, and demonstrate that this correction enables prediction of unbinding distances and dissociation rates that are decoupled from the stiffness of actual or simulated molecular linkers.},

  abstract = {Chemically induced dimerization (CID) has been applied to study numerous biological processes and has important pharmacological applications. However, the complex multistep interactions under various physical constraints involved in CID impose a great challenge for the quantification of the interactions. Furthermore, the mechanical stability of the ternary complexes has not been characterized; hence, their potential application in mechanotransduction studies remains unclear. Here, we report a single-molecule detector that can accurately quantify almost all key interactions involved in CID and the mechanical stability of the ternary complex, in a label-free manner. Its application is demonstrated using rapamycin-induced heterodimerization of FRB and FKBP as an example. We revealed the sufficient mechanical stability of the FKBP/rapamycin/FRB ternary complex and demonstrated its utility in the precise switching of talin-mediated force transmission in integrin-based cell adhesions.},
